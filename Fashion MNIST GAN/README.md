<h1 align="center">GANS on fashion MNIST</h1>

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are deep neural net architectures comprising of a set of two networks which compete against the other, hence the name “adversarial”.
The two networks are called Generator and Discriminator. A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<b>The notebook <i>DCGAN_fashionMNIST.ipynb</i> implements GAN on fashion mnist dataset. <br>
The dataset has been loaded from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/fashion_mnist/load_data">tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data</a> module.</b><br>
<br>The architecture of Generator and Discriminator models are as follows:

>Further details has been documented inside the notebook itself.


<h2>Model training</h2>

The model has been trained on Google Colab using GPU.<br>
