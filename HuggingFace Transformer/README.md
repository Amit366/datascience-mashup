**Transformer**  
In “Attention Is All You Need”, Google introduce the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture based on a self-attention mechanism that we believe to be particularly well suited for language understanding.

A Transformer network applies self-attention mechanism which scans through every word and appends attention scores(weights) to the words. The Transformer was introduced as a simple network architecture, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

### The various tasks performed in this notebook are : 
- **Text generation (in English):** provide a prompt and the model will generate what follows.
- **Sentiment analysis:** is a text positive or negative?
- **Question answering:** provide the model with some context and a question, extract the answer from the context.
- **Summarization:** generate a summary of a long text.
- **Language Translation:** translate a text into another language.
- **Text Prediction:** Predicts the next words for a given sentence.
