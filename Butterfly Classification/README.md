# Dataset
* This dataset contains images and textual descriptions for ten categories (species) of butterflies.

* The image dataset comprises 832 images in total, with the distribution ranging from 55 to 100 images per category. Images were collected from Google Images by querying with the scientific (Latin) name of the species, for example "Danaus plexippus", and manually filtered for those depicting the butterfly of interest.
