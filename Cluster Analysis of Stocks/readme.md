# Clustering for Diversification analysis
- Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.
- The data frame consists of the closing prices of 30 different stocks,each from one market cap (Small,Large and Mid).
- The average annual percentage return and volatility of all 30 stocks over a theoretical one-year period are calculated first. The code clusters the 30 stocks according to their mean annual volatilities and Returns using K-means clustering.
- The optimum number of clusters is found using the Elbow curve method.
